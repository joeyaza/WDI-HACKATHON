##DRAWING AT CHRISTMAS


####Why

The site was built by me and 3 others during a 24hr hackathon during my course at General Assembly. We chose to use Firebase as we had only used framework briefly and so wished to discover it's capabilities further. 


####What?

Drawing at Christmas is a whimsical multiplayer drawing game built using Firebase based on Paint and Pictionary.
Players view a common picture and draw together on one paint canvas, being able to view what the other players are drawing in real time. 
We decided to use Christmas at the styling focal point as we completed the site toward the end of December 2015.
